<b>Freshness</b>
Add-on to randomize specific CSS styles for each card to add some freshness to your study and possibly prevent you from memorizing the "shape" of a quesiton and answering based on that instead of memorizing the actual content.
The add-on is inspired by a script in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/12n6dg1/simple_script_that_made_my_study_sessions_more/">this Reddit thread</a>. The default styles to randomize are also based on it. I ran the text &amp; background color combinations through a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">constrast checker</a> and adjusted them accordingly. One difference from the script is that the the add-on currently applies to all cards (This was my main motivation of writing an add-on instead of just using the script.) I may add an option to change this in the future. Also note that the add-on dynamically changes the styles and never modifies your templates, so it won't work on mobile. I may add an option to change that too.
You can customize the add-on from <i>Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Config</i>.
Recommended to use with the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/897478712">Random Sprites</a> add-on.
