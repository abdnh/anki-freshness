# Freshness

Anki add-on to randomize specific CSS styles for each card to add some freshness to your study and possibly prevent you from memorizing the "shape" of a quesiton and answering based on that instead of memorizing the actual content.

The add-on is inspired by a script in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/12n6dg1/simple_script_that_made_my_study_sessions_more/).
The default styles to randomize are also based on it. I ran the text & background color combinations through a [constrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and adjusted them accordingly.
One difference from the script is that the the add-on currently applies to all cards (This was my main motivation of writing an add-on instead of just using the script.)
I may add an option to change this in the future.
Also note that the add-on dynamically changes the styles and never modifies your templates, so it won't work on mobile.
I may add an option to change that too.

You can customize the add-on from _Tools > Add-ons > Config_.

Recommended to use with the [Random Sprites](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/897478712) add-on.
